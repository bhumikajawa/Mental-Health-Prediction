Mental health is a major public health concern across the world, with a rising number of people dealing with mental health issues. The importance of early identification and prompt intervention in enhancing outcomes and lowering the burden of mental health issues cannot be overstated.
These illnesses have serious personal, social, and economic repercussions on people of all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. More than 450 million people worldwide suffer from mental health illnesses, making it one of the top causes of disability globally, according to the
World Health Organisation.
In order to predict mental health, machine learning methods such as deep learning, decision trees, and random forest are essential. Large and complicated datasets may be processed by these algorithms, which can also find hidden patterns and forecast the future using learnt patterns from prior data. The potential of machine learning models for mental health is growing along with the
area of artificial intelligence. To sum up, mental health prediction has the power to completely alter the way we approach mental health treatment. Healthcare practitioners may enhance early identification, intervention,
and individualised treatment options for those with mental health difficulties by using the potential of artificial intelligence.
